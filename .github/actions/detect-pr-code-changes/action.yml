name: Detect PR Code Changes
description: |
  Detects if a PR contains changes that would trigger image building in CI.
  Only returns true for changes in: services/api, services/workers, services/shared, apps/web, docker files.
  This ensures preview deployments only run when images are actually available.

  ROOT CAUSE FIX: Previously returned true for ANY non-docs change, causing preview to run
  even when CI didn't build images (e.g., workflow changes). Now aligned with CI build triggers.
