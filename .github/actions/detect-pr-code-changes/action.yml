name: Detect PR Code Changes
description: |
  Detects if a PR contains changes that would trigger image building in CI.
  Uses git diff to reliably get ALL changed files between base and head commits.
  Only returns true for changes in: services/api, services/workers, services/shared, apps/web, docker files.
  This ensures preview deployments only run when images are actually available.

  BETTER APPROACH: Uses git diff instead of GitHub API for reliability.
  No longer limited by API pagination or commit history issues.

inputs:
  base-sha:
    description: Base commit SHA to compare against (defaults to origin/main)
    required: false
    default: 'origin/main'
  head-sha:
    description: Head commit SHA to compare (defaults to HEAD)
    required: false
    default: 'HEAD'
  force-preview-labels:
    description: Comma-separated list of labels that force preview deployment
    required: false
    default: 'preview,force-preview'

outputs:
  has_code_changes:
    description: Whether the PR contains code changes
    value: ${{ steps.detect.outputs.has_code_changes }}
